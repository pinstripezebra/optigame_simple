It's time to create your island: a 4x4 tableau of self-supporting growth, expansion and supply where even the cards you don't need become compost for future gain. OVERVIEW: Earth is an open-world engine builder for 1 to 5 players with simple rules and countless strategic possibilities. With its encyclopedic nature and a near-infinite number of tableau combinations, every single game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections, just as our vast and fascinating world allows us to do! Players will create a self-supporting engine of growth, expansion, and supply by drafting from a deck of over 364 unique cards and strategically placing them in their tableau. STARTING THE GAME - The game begins before the starting hand has even been drafted. Players will receive an Island, Climate, and Ecosystem card during set-up. Using these double-sided cards, each player sows their strategy by selecting one side of the card to place face-up in their play area. The combination of these three cards introduces asymmetry to the game by providing variable starting resources, bonus abilities, and unique end-game scoring objectives. ON YOUR TURN - On their turn, the active player will choose one of four different actions, reaping their major benefits, while all other players welcome the minor benefit. Subsequently, all players activate any cards on their player-board, and in their tableau, which match the color of the chosen action. Players continue taking actions, arranging their Island, sowing Plants and developing Terrains to attract elusive Fauna, and unlock the scoring bonuses of diverse Ecosystems. TRIGGERING END GAME - Once a player has added a sixteenth card to their 4×4 tableau, they earn a completion bonus and trigger the end of the game. All players will tally the victory points they earned from completing Ecosystems, reaching Fauna objectives, Composting cards, gaining Plant cubes and Growth pieces, for their Plant and Terrain values and for Events played. The player with the most victory points wins! Game Playtime (min): 45. Number of Players: 5."

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, bestest castle ever — subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle they're building while also selling their services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players. The Master Builder will then pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid the Master Builder for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entrance ways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most accommodating to the King's demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins!"
