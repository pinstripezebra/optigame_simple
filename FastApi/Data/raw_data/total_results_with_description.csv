OVERVIEW: Earth is an open-world engine builder for 1 to 5 players with simple rules and countless strategic possibilities. With its encyclopedic nature and a near-infinite number of tableau combinations, every single game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections, just as our vast and fascinating world allows us to do! Players will create a self-supporting engine of growth, expansion, and supply by drafting from a deck of over 364 unique cards and strategically placing them in their tableau. STARTING THE GAME - The game begins before the starting hand has even been drafted. Players will receive an Island, Climate, and Ecosystem card during set-up. Using these double-sided cards, each player sows their strategy by selecting one side of the card to place face-up in their play area. The combination of these three cards introduces asymmetry to the game by providing variable starting resources, bonus abilities, and unique end-game scoring objectives. ON YOUR TURN - On their turn, the active player will choose one of four different actions, reaping their major benefits, while all other players welcome the minor benefit. Subsequently, all players activate any cards on their player-board, and in their tableau, which match the color of the chosen action. Players continue taking actions, arranging their Island, sowing Plants and developing Terrains to attract elusive Fauna, and unlock the scoring bonuses of diverse Ecosystems. TRIGGERING END GAME - Once a player has added a sixteenth card to their 4×4 tableau, they earn a completion bonus and trigger the end of the game. All players will tally the victory points they earned from completing Ecosystems, reaching Fauna objectives, Composting cards, gaining Plant cubes and Growth pieces, for their Plant and Terrain values and for Events played. The player with the most victory points wins! Game Playtime (min): 45. Number of Players: 5.",367.0

Get this game out the next time the power goes off and show the kids some old-fashioned fun. --Marcie Bovetz P.when('A').execute(function(A) { A.on('a:expander:toggle_description:toggle:collapse', function(data) { window.scroll(0, data.expander.$expander[0].offsetTop-100); }); }); From the Manufacturer It's no surprise that Rummikub is so popular--it has all the elements that make a great game: it's easy to learn and fast moving, it's different every time it's played, it combines luck and strategy, and it changes quickly so every player has a chance to win until the very end. And with more than 50 million units sold, Rummikub is one of the world's best-selling, and most-played, games. Players take turns placing numbered tiles in runs (consecutive numbers of the same color, like 2, 3, 4 in red) and groups (three or more of the same number in different colors, like a red 9, a blue 9, and a black 9), rummy style. It's easy to learn, but packed with strategy--the ""board"" changes all the time as players adjust the tiles on the table. The Joker tiles add to the fun; they can be any color or number. The object is to be the first player to play every tile on your rack. Players keep track of who wins each round--the player who wins the most rounds wins this time-tested tile game (there's also a point system for use as a tie-breaker). Rummikub is ideal for people of different ages to play together, and it's great for a game night too. When kids play, it reinforces STEM and STEAM concepts such as sequencing, pattern recognition, and planning skills. It's got lots of exciting moments, but it's also designed to bring people together, with plenty of opportunities for talking, chatting, and sharing with family and friends. Rummikub includes 106 high-quality plastic tiles, 4 plastic tile-holder racks, and illustrated instructions. For 2 or more players ages 8 and up. See more",33543.0

It's time to create your island: a 4x4 tableau of self-supporting growth, expansion and supply where even the cards you don't need become compost for future gain. OVERVIEW: Earth is an open-world engine builder for 1 to 5 players with simple rules and countless strategic possibilities. With its encyclopedic nature and a near-infinite number of tableau combinations, every single game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections, just as our vast and fascinating world allows us to do! Players will create a self-supporting engine of growth, expansion, and supply by drafting from a deck of over 364 unique cards and strategically placing them in their tableau. STARTING THE GAME - The game begins before the starting hand has even been drafted. Players will receive an Island, Climate, and Ecosystem card during set-up. Using these double-sided cards, each player sows their strategy by selecting one side of the card to place face-up in their play area. The combination of these three cards introduces asymmetry to the game by providing variable starting resources, bonus abilities, and unique end-game scoring objectives. ON YOUR TURN - On their turn, the active player will choose one of four different actions, reaping their major benefits, while all other players welcome the minor benefit. Subsequently, all players activate any cards on their player-board, and in their tableau, which match the color of the chosen action. Players continue taking actions, arranging their Island, sowing Plants and developing Terrains to attract elusive Fauna, and unlock the scoring bonuses of diverse Ecosystems. TRIGGERING END GAME - Once a player has added a sixteenth card to their 4×4 tableau, they earn a completion bonus and trigger the end of the game. All players will tally the victory points they earned from completing Ecosystems, reaching Fauna objectives, Composting cards, gaining Plant cubes and Growth pieces, for their Plant and Terrain values and for Events played. The player with the most victory points wins! Game Playtime (min): 45. Number of Players: 5.",367.0

Master Each Game Mode Band together, compete for glory, gang up against one player, or go it alone with this cooperative family board game’s 4 unique game modes. Each game’s basic story is the same—players (or a single player) fight against orcs, goblins, and trolls in a do-or-die battle for Castle Bravehold. Different game modes to change how you play. Co-op: Work with your sisters- and brothers-in-arms to defend your towers. If at least one castle stands at the end of the onslaught, you all achieve victory. If monsters destroy all your towers, you fail. Master Slayer: You lose on the same conditions as you do in co-op, and just one winner takes home the crown (as well as some bragging rights) by single-handedly slaying the most monsters. Overlord: Choose one player to control the monsters. Whereas the other game modes’ monster attacks are random, this time the monsters know how you think. Be afraid. Solitaire: Stand alone against all the trolls, goblins, and orcs that threaten your castle. Whatever play style you choose, connect over Fireside Games while you do it.",2712.0

With more than 2 million copies sold, Azul has become a beloved game worldwide, and now you can enjoy it anywhere you like.

The challenge lies in creating beautiful mosaics while outwitting your opponents. Collect sets of the same color tiles for extra points or craft intricate patterns to gain an advantage. Azul's ruleset is elegantly simple, making it accessible to players of all levels. On your turn, you'll carefully select tiles from a central market and decide where to place them on your board.

Taking too many of a particular tile type can cost you points, but leaving rows incomplete won't earn you any either. This portable version of Azul allows you to become an artisan on the go. Draft tiles, disrupt your opponents' plans, and aim for the highest score, all in a convenient, mini-sized package.

When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entrance ways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.

The Seahawks of 1979 didn't always win, but one thing was constant: they were always entertaining. A high-flying passing game, bold play-calling and porous defense combined to make every Seahawks game an unpredictable affair. There were many highlights along the way, inclduing impressive victories over playoff contenders Houston and Cleveland, a Monday night classic with the Falcons that showcased the Seahawks' daring for a national audience and late-season triumphs over the hated Broncos and Raiders that severely damaged both teams' playoff hopes. All of the highs and lows from the exciting season are here. A full recap and box score from every game is included, so you can follow the exploits of Jack Patera's young gang from start to finish as it proved that 1978's winning record was no fluke.
As an added bonus, links to video highlights of the crazy win at Atlanta and the original TV broadcast of the historic game with the Rams are included to add more depth to the story of the '79 Seahawks. Whether you are a die-hard Seahawks fan or an NFL history buff, you will enjoy this look back at the 1979 Seattle Seahawks.",

The Legend of the Archeans This game is centered on the legend of the Archean empire, a civilization that possessed the ability to control the Earth's core elements--fire, wind, water, and earth--through four sacred treasures. These treasures stayed hidden from enemies for years on the Forbidden Island, which was designed to sink if intruders ever attempted to capture them. Set the appropriate water level for your gaming skill, and let the adventures begin! Capture the Four Sacred Treasures Before the Island Sinks! Your team of adventurers must work together to keep the Forbidden Island from sinking as you seek the four treasures hidden within. The mission is carried out using different combinations of Flood, Treasure, and Adventurer Cards on the 24 tiles that make up the Forbidden Island. Once you've captured each treasure using the appropriate cards, you must make it to Fools' Landing and escape by helicopter in order to win. If the island sinks before you complete your tasks, the mission ends in defeat. Use Collaborative Play to Succeed Each player is dealt an Adventure Card and given a corresponding pawn before the game starts, designating him or her with a certain set of strengths. This game is designed so that instead of competing with other players, you work to find the treasures and find out how to best use each Adventurer's strengths through collaborative play.

a6355270-1d5f-4e67-998b-cce5fd8ab12a,B0DL8QJ7F2,Solo RPG Hexcrawls,,,,"When I first stumbled upon the concept of hexcrawls, I had no idea how much it would reshape the way I thought about tabletop role-playing games. It was a simple idea—explore the world one hex at a time—but within that simplicity, I found something truly profound. Unlike traditional, linear RPGs that guide you from one pre-defined plot point to the next, a hexcrawl allows you to carve your own path. It hands you the map (sometimes quite literally) and says: Go. Discover. Shape the world as you explore it
.
That sense of freedom is what drew me in. There’s something deeply satisfying about watching your characters venture into the unknown, knowing that every choice you make has the potential to lead to adventure, danger, or discovery.
Solo RPG Hexcrawls is born from a desire to explore that potential, to unlock what makes hexcrawling such a powerful and flexible tool for role-playing games.
We’ll start with the basics—what exactly a hexcrawl is, how it works, and why it’s such a perfect match for solo and co-op play. From there, we’ll dive deeper into the mechanics of building hexcrawls, populating them with points of interest, and running them effectively across a variety of settings and genres. We’ll examine how wilderness exploration differs from dungeon crawling and explore ways to adapt hexcrawling to popular systems that weren’t originally designed for it, like Ironsworn or Blades in the Dark
.
But Solo RPG Hexcrawls isn’t just about systems and mechanics. It’s about stories. The story of your character and your world—and how those stories evolve as you explore the unknown. Hexcrawls create a unique sense of narrative freedom, where the world around you feels alive and reactive, shaped by your choices as much as by any game rule. That’s what makes them special.
Throughout this book, you’ll find examples, tools, and strategies to help you create meaningful and memorable experiences in your own hexcrawls. You’ll also find advice on how to keep the game fun, engaging, and full of surprises, no matter how many hexes you’ve explored or how many dungeons you’ve delved into.

It was a simple idea—explore the world one hex at a time—but within that simplicity, I found something truly profound. Unlike traditional, linear RPGs that guide you from one pre-defined plot point to the next, a hexcrawl allows you to carve your own path. It hands you the map (sometimes quite literally) and says: Go. Discover. Shape the world as you explore it
.
That sense of freedom is what drew me in. There’s something deeply satisfying about watching your characters venture into the unknown, knowing that every choice you make has the potential to lead to adventure, danger, or discovery.
Solo RPG Hexcrawls is born from a desire to explore that potential, to unlock what makes hexcrawling such a powerful and flexible tool for role-playing games.
We’ll start with the basics—what exactly a hexcrawl is, how it works, and why it’s such a perfect match for solo and co-op play. From there, we’ll dive deeper into the mechanics of building hexcrawls, populating them with points of interest, and running them effectively across a variety of settings and genres. We’ll examine how wilderness exploration differs from dungeon crawling and explore ways to adapt hexcrawling to popular systems that weren’t originally designed for it, like Ironsworn or Blades in the Dark

When humans first arrived, they thought they found an unspoiled paradise, but as their settlements expanded, nature itself pushed back. Great creatures known as Beasts emerged, determined to protect their land. One player will take on the role of the Beast, while the other players work together as skilled hunters. The Beast uses a deck of direction cards to move over forests, swamps, and caverns, using guile and deceit to hide its tracks from the hunters. Hunters have one chance to search each round, making it a tense decision as they follow the trail. Each action is performed by playing up to two cards per turn. Before each round players will draft for the most important cards. All action cards can be used by both the Beast and hunters alike. Hunters will need to cooperate and strategize to defeat the Beast and the Beast will need to skillfully outmaneuver the crafty hunters to reclaim their territory. Work together as skilled hunters or defend your domain as a giant god¬like beast in an epic one-vs-many game with hidden movement and card drafting. Which side will you join?""",

e167c670-c946-4537-aad0-be6ce4b24779,B0DL8QJ7F2,Solo RPG Hexcrawls,,,,"When I first stumbled upon the concept of hexcrawls, I had no idea how much it would reshape the way I thought about tabletop role-playing games. It was a simple idea—explore the world one hex at a time—but within that simplicity, I found something truly profound. Unlike traditional, linear RPGs that guide you from one pre-defined plot point to the next, a hexcrawl allows you to carve your own path. It hands you the map (sometimes quite literally) and says: Go. Discover. Shape the world as you explore it
.
That sense of freedom is what drew me in. There’s something deeply satisfying about watching your characters venture into the unknown, knowing that every choice you make has the potential to lead to adventure, danger, or discovery.
Solo RPG Hexcrawls is born from a desire to explore that potential, to unlock what makes hexcrawling such a powerful and flexible tool for role-playing games.
We’ll start with the basics—what exactly a hexcrawl is, how it works, and why it’s such a perfect match for solo and co-op play. From there, we’ll dive deeper into the mechanics of building hexcrawls, populating them with points of interest, and running them effectively across a variety of settings and genres. We’ll examine how wilderness exploration differs from dungeon crawling and explore ways to adapt hexcrawling to popular systems that weren’t originally designed for it, like Ironsworn or Blades in the Dark
.
But Solo RPG Hexcrawls isn’t just about systems and mechanics. It’s about stories. The story of your character and your world—and how those stories evolve as you explore the unknown. Hexcrawls create a unique sense of narrative freedom, where the world around you feels alive and reactive, shaped by your choices as much as by any game rule. That’s what makes them special.
Throughout this book, you’ll find examples, tools, and strategies to help you create meaningful and memorable experiences in your own hexcrawls. You’ll also find advice on how to keep the game fun, engaging, and full of surprises, no matter how many hexes you’ve explored or how many dungeons you’ve delved into.

OVERVIEW: Earth is an open-world engine builder for 1 to 5 players with simple rules and countless strategic possibilities. With its encyclopedic nature and a near-infinite number of tableau combinations, every single game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections, just as our vast and fascinating world allows us to do! Players will create a self-supporting engine of growth, expansion, and supply by drafting from a deck of over 364 unique cards and strategically placing them in their tableau. STARTING THE GAME - The game begins before the starting hand has even been drafted. Players will receive an Island, Climate, and Ecosystem card during set-up. Using these double-sided cards, each player sows their strategy by selecting one side of the card to place face-up in their play area. The combination of these three cards introduces asymmetry to the game by providing variable starting resources, bonus abilities, and unique end-game scoring objectives. ON YOUR TURN - On their turn, the active player will choose one of four different actions, reaping their major benefits, while all other players welcome the minor benefit. Subsequently, all players activate any cards on their player-board, and in their tableau, which match the color of the chosen action. Players continue taking actions, arranging their Island, sowing Plants and developing Terrains to attract elusive Fauna, and unlock the scoring bonuses of diverse Ecosystems. TRIGGERING END GAME - Once a player has added a sixteenth card to their 4×4 tableau, they earn a completion bonus and trigger the end of the game. All players will tally the victory points they earned from completing Ecosystems, reaching Fauna objectives, Composting cards, gaining Plant cubes and Growth pieces, for their Plant and Terrain values and for Events played.
