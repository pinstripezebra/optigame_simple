Most who try end up face-down in a crater somewhere, not a thing to their name—barring the bullet in their back. You want to make it anywhere out there, you need more than just a dream: you need the right people at your back so that they can take the bullets for you. Between the Brotherhood, the Super Mutants, the Raiders and even those well-meaning few who think their way of living is the only right one, there’s plenty of competition for that cut of the world. So, you’d better be the best of the best, or else this place will chew you up and spit you right back out again.” Fallout: Factions is a skirmish-level wargame for two players, where you take control of a crew of Wastelanders vying for power in an irradiated hellscape, full to bursting with monsters, mercenaries, and murderous miscreants—all doing exactly the same. Over the course of several games, crews will rise and fall, each moving through their own stories thanks to an intricate Campaign system. On the tabletop, players control a unique group of miniatures, representing a core Faction from the Fallout universe, and bring them to battle the crews of other players in a fast-paced, dice-hurling, action-packed skirmish wargame—where every action can have long-lasting consequences. THIS BOOK CONTAINS all you need to know to take to the Wasteland, teaching you the rules of play, the in-depth Campaign system, and showcasing the iconic Factions of Fallout, helping you decide which flag to carry to battle. Combined with the Fallout: Factions “Battle for Nuka-World” Starter Set, or the Fallout: Factions Tokens and Terrain Pack, you’ll have everything needed to pick a Faction and start your journey to become the de-facto ruler of the Wasteland—as long as you don’t mind crushing a competitor or two along the way.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yiXHwgQWL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game. Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition - but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests! Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies and keep the colony's morale up. Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SgtLjS4RL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

ACTION CARDS bring various interesting options for action into the game, which reward tactical foresight and promote interaction between the players. Possible actions are, for example, double play, looking at face-down cards in a column or row, swapping cards in your own display, swapping cards with other players, action card thief, etc.
STAR CARDS can be ""converted"" for a short moment into any number card that is in the same column or row as it is. Star cards thus help to collect triplets and quadruplets that have been reached and can be discarded with all their points.

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, bestest castle ever — subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle they're building while also selling their services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players. The Master Builder will then pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid the Master Builder for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entrance ways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most accommodating to the King's demands, which change each game.

After all, who doesn't like to see a pirate get shot out of a barrel? The game is simple. The unlucky pirate is pushed into the top of a brown plastic barrel, readying the spring mechanism for his eventual launch. Players then take turns pushing colorful plastic swords into holes on the side of the barrel, one by one until finally someone releases the spring and sends the poor little pirate on his way. Whoever makes the pirate pop loses, until the next round at any rate. The game includes a blue plastic base, the brown barrel (the sort that pirates would use for grog), and 24 plastic swords--six each of yellow, red, green, and blue. There's also lots of stickers of birds, smiling sharks, and even an ogling octopus, although they don't stay stuck very well. The pirate himself has a big black mustache and wears an eye patch and a purple plastic scarf over his head. Luckily, he doesn't seem to mind getting jounced around so much, since he also has a gigantic, if somewhat cautious, grin. --David Morel P.when('A').execute(function(A) { A.on('a:expander:toggle_description:toggle:collapse', function(data) { window.scroll(0, data.expander.$expander[0].offsetTop-100); }); }); From the Manufacturer Push the pirate into the barrel, select your sword, then slide the swords into the barrel slots.

In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective. In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time. Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points. From the Manufacturer The Dawn of Mankind. Our ancestors were hard workers, resting only very little. Luckily for us, their ingenuity allowed them to make their work easier, day after day. In Stone Age, players are sent back to that arduous period of history. With tools, quite archaic at first, you will be able to collect wood, stone and gold. These resources will allow you to attain higher levels of knowledge and build sturdier roofs over your head. Though luck plays an im­portant part in the game, only those who master their fate will be able to grasp victory. Finally, one mustn't forget to feed their tribe as that would represent a major setback for them. Relive history.

Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): 1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network. 3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5) Loan - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action: 6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.) The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham. New ""Sell"" system Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also ""grease the wheels of industry"" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. Birmingham features three all-new industry types: Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. Brass: Birmingham is a finely brewed sequel to one of history's most industrial economic games. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.

In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective. In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time. Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points. From the Manufacturer The Dawn of Mankind. Our ancestors were hard workers, resting only very little. Luckily for us, their ingenuity allowed them to make their work easier, day after day. In Stone Age, players are sent back to that arduous period of history. With tools, quite archaic at first, you will be able to collect wood, stone and gold. These resources will allow you to attain higher levels of knowledge and build sturdier roofs over your head. Though luck plays an im­portant part in the game, only those who master their fate will be able to grasp victory. Finally, one mustn't forget to feed their tribe as that would represent a major setback for them. Relive history.

With its encyclopedic nature and a near-infinite number of tableau combinations, every single game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections, just as our vast and fascinating world allows us to do! Players will create a self-supporting engine of growth, expansion, and supply by drafting from a deck of over 364 unique cards and strategically placing them in their tableau. STARTING THE GAME - The game begins before the starting hand has even been drafted. Players will receive an Island, Climate, and Ecosystem card during set-up. Using these double-sided cards, each player sows their strategy by selecting one side of the card to place face-up in their play area. The combination of these three cards introduces asymmetry to the game by providing variable starting resources, bonus abilities, and unique end-game scoring objectives. ON YOUR TURN - On their turn, the active player will choose one of four different actions, reaping their major benefits, while all other players welcome the minor benefit. Subsequently, all players activate any cards on their player-board, and in their tableau, which match the color of the chosen action. Players continue taking actions, arranging their Island, sowing Plants and developing Terrains to attract elusive Fauna, and unlock the scoring bonuses of diverse Ecosystems. TRIGGERING END GAME - Once a player has added a sixteenth card to their 4×4 tableau, they earn a completion bonus and trigger the end of the game. All players will tally the victory points they earned from completing Ecosystems, reaching Fauna objectives, Composting cards, gaining Plant cubes and Growth pieces, for their Plant and Terrain values and for Events played.

The Piggy Piggy game is a fast-paced family card game that’s as easy as it is fun! Players take turns playing food cards from their hand to try to steal pigs and score the most points. Each player starts with 5 cards, including colored food cards, such as tacos (yellow) and ice cream (pink). On their turn, a player plays all the cards they have from one type of food by placing it in a stack. If their stack has the most food, then they earn the same-colored pig figure—or can steal it from another player! Have a goat card? Use it to sabotage an opponent by discarding a food card from their stack and maybe forcing them to give up their pig! When a player redraws cards at the end of their turn, if they have any pigs, they’ll score a point for each drawn card that matches their pig’s color. Score 8 points first to win! The Piggy Piggy game is a fantastic choice for those looking for fun card games for kids and adults.

Just don't role a ""Pig Out"" or an ""Oinker."" For example, if both pigs land on all fours, that's called a ""Double Trotter"" and you'll earn 20 points. Other classic scoring rolls include standard (single) Trotters, Razorbacks (standard and double), the famous Leaning Jowler, and more! The first person to 100 points wins. Makes an ideal travel game with its small plastic carrying case. Amazon.com How's your tolerance for puns? You'll need some for Pass the Pigs, a simple game of chance built around a pig theme. Instead of dice, you roll two cute pink piglets, and you gain or lose points depending on how the critters land. For example, if both land on all fours, called a ""double trotter,"" you get 20 points; if they land lying opposite each other, called a ""Pig Out,"" you gain no points and cede your turn. There are a number of other rules as well as a variation called ""Hog Call.""

They learn ways to remember their cards and strategies to figure out what cards other players might have. They also begin to develop an intuitive sense of probability. Rat-a-tat Cat requires skill, strategy, and awareness, challenging both young children and adults. Amazon.com It's never too early to develop a good poker face. With Rat-a-Tat Cat , a poker face is just one of the skills players need to perfect. As in poker, luck, skill, strategy, and intuition each play a part. Players are dealt four cards, which are kept face- down, except for a quick peek at two of them. Each player in turn pulls a card from the draw pile to replace one of the four. Memory is important, as the object is to end with the lowest score, and players must keep track of the values on their four cards. ""Peek,"" ""Swap,"" and ""Draw Two"" Power cards turn up occasionally, allowing players to maneuver and strategize further. Delightfully witty pictures of cats (the good guys--low points) and rats (bad guys--high points) illustrate each of the 54 cards. Young card sharks will develop a sense of timing and greater ease with numbers, and can begin to grasp the concept of probability.

Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): 1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network. 3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5) Loan - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action: 6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.) The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham. New ""Sell"" system Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also ""grease the wheels of industry"" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. Birmingham features three all-new industry types: Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. Brass: Birmingham is a finely brewed sequel to one of history's most industrial economic games. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. Many of the tried and true strategies of the original are no longer as powerful as they once were, and other interesting new strategies are waiting for you to discover.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aB72ceITL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

They thought that there had to be a better way!
A foldable board was the answer.
We spend a lot of time talking to other tabletop RPG players. This provides us with ideas for new products.
Our products are unique and innovative. We enjoy trying new ideas and fine-tuning them.
Products get copied so we have to keep innovating.
We recommend correctable pens for long-lasting outlines and dry-erase markers for short-term drawings. The dry-erase markers can easily be erased with fingers or pieces of cloth, erasing the correctables requires the use of the erasing tip.
The use of a damp cloth or micro cloth is required for most markings after a couple of days (a little rubbing alcohol can help too), this also helps against smudging. No pens or markers are included.
​The classic board is foldable and measures 13.5'' x 11.5''x 0.4'' fully folded. The classic box measures 13.75'' x 11.75'' x 1.75'' and can easily fit in a backpack. This leaves some empty space in the provided box that can be filled with dice, miniatures, map tiles, rulebooks, sheets, and markers.
The drawings can be left on the board when folding. This is convenient for multiple gaming sessions requiring the same terrain.
The XL board and box are slightly bigger: the board is 17''x11''x0.75'' fully folded and the box is 17.25''x11.25''x 2''.
The boxes are compatible with Hexers GM Screen. It fits in the box next to the board.
NOT INCLUDED: Backpack, Hexers GM Screen, Markers, Dice, Rulebooks
Your party has just entered a fearsome dungeon looking to complete its quest. Your DM pulls out his Hexers RPG board: he is well-prepared as always. On his board you see the outlines of the dungeon drawn in black correctable ink, the details are filled out with the dry erasable variant in many different colors.
He confidently gets the miniatures out of this mysterious red box: it seems as if it is related to the board. Your party is surprised! You are used to him rolling out vinyl maps.
But somehow you do not mind, the board seems strangely familiar yet novel and intriguing. Your DM lets go a smile: ""I recently bought this board. It just seemed awesome and very practical. I wanted to try something new!"". Your party fully heartedly agrees: ""Yes it looks quite fancy!"". You all slowly look back to the game, the freshly placed monsters and everyone rolls for initiative.

When humans first arrived, they thought they found an unspoiled paradise, but as their settlements expanded, nature itself pushed back. Great creatures known as Beasts emerged, determined to protect their land. One player will take on the role of the Beast, while the other players work together as skilled hunters. The Beast uses a deck of direction cards to move over forests, swamps, and caverns, using guile and deceit to hide its tracks from the hunters. Hunters have one chance to search each round, making it a tense decision as they follow the trail. Each action is performed by playing up to two cards per turn. Before each round players will draft for the most important cards. All action cards can be used by both the Beast and hunters alike. Hunters will need to cooperate and strategize to defeat the Beast and the Beast will need to skillfully outmaneuver the crafty hunters to reclaim their territory. Work together as skilled hunters or defend your domain as a giant god¬like beast in an epic one-vs-many game with hidden movement and card drafting.

B0CB3VVBLJ,Beast - Board Game,0,0,0,0,"Long Dog Games is an employee-owned small business based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Their mission is to share their love of games with the world by creating fun, unique gaming experiences. Their debut game, Pericle: Gathering Darkness, was funded by dedicated Kickstarter backers and strives to bridge a gap between the old and new generations of gamers by combining traditional tabletop roleplaying with sleek, app-guided gameplay.
No Game Master or preparation required! A computer or tablet sits at the table so that Loremaster can serve the role of Game Master. This game is perfect for when your usual RPG group isn't available, or when you wish to set off on an adventure by yourself.
Experience the world of Pericle through Loremaster, which presents the Gathering Darkness campaign through rich narratives, animated cutscenes, breathtaking art, and an original soundtrack.
The world is rich with history, culture, factions, politics, religions and NPCs. Most importantly, Loremaster’s branching storylines change according to player choice; your decisions shape the world of Pericle!
Pericle: Gathering Darkness has a classless creation system that allows players to build their own unique characters with varying weapon proficiencies, skills, and magic abilities. Players can even change heroes or builds mid-campaign if they wish!
The hero creation system is complex and detailed, so for players who wish to learn the game before building their own, 5 pre-generated heroes are included in the core game for beginners.
Gathering Darkness is the first of many Pericle campaigns. It can take as little as 1 hour to play each session if desired, or players can continue until they wish to end. Loremaster saves the progress, so you can pick up right where you left off!
We estimate that it takes more than 60 hours of gameplay to finish the Gathering Darkness campaign. Players can choose to create more than one party and make different decisions to influence the story on each new play-through!
Pericle: Gathering Darkness standees are made of strong acrylic and have removable bases. Each hero standee features unique, double-sided artwork. Standees are covered in a thin plastic film to protect the artwork while shipping, which can be removed on arrival.
Pericle: Gathering Darkness core game contains 25 double-sided, full color chipboard maps. Each of the unique battle maps featured in the Gathering Darkness campaign are the creation of Eric Henson, The Modern Lich. Eric has created maps and assets for use with D&D, Pathfinder, and other tabletop RPGs, and his talents help bring the vibrancy and danger of Pericle to life in the maps!
Each map is numbered for ease of use. When it's time to set up the tabletop for battle, Loremaster will indicate which map to take out and where to place enemy and hero standees. Hazards on the map, such as water or lava, are explained in the combat setup. These vibrant maps set the scene on the tabletop and create a backdrop for the battle.
The Pericle: Gathering Darkness story unfolds inside Loremaster, our companion app. Loremaster presents everything to players, from soundtrack to cutscenes. Most importantly, Loremaster relays story arcs and decisions for your group of heroes to make.
​
Pericle: Gathering Darkness isn't just about combat; mystery, political intrigue, and exploration all await you from the moment you set foot in the Jarin Isles. But along the way, you're bound to come into conflict with a host of enemies. When combat is inevitable, Loremaster will bring up the combat screen.
Setup for combat is quick and simple! Loremaster will tell you which map to use, where to place enemies, and where you can place your own heroes - and then it's time for the battle to begin. Dice are rolled, standees moved, spells cast, and attacks made. Players move through initiative, movement, and action rounds until the combat is resolved. The result is entered in to Loremaster, and then the adventure continues.
Pericle: Gathering Darkness is a bold new tabletop RPG that combines a fantasy RPG world with a ground-breaking web-based app called Loremaster. App-driven gameplay presents the campaign, which takes away the need for a Game Master, and offers branching storylines so that player decisions impact and change the world around them. Dice-based combat and important story decisions anchor Pericle: Gathering Darkness in the realm of classic RPG gaming, while streamlined mechanics and a classless hero creation system give players the freedom to engage in tactical combat using totally unique characters. The world of Pericle awaits!

You want to make it anywhere out there, you need more than just a dream: you need the right people at your back so that they can take the bullets for you. Between the Brotherhood, the Super Mutants, the Raiders and even those well-meaning few who think their way of living is the only right one, there’s plenty of competition for that cut of the world. So, you’d better be the best of the best, or else this place will chew you up and spit you right back out again.” Fallout: Factions is a skirmish-level wargame for two players, where you take control of a crew of Wastelanders vying for power in an irradiated hellscape, full to bursting with monsters, mercenaries, and murderous miscreants—all doing exactly the same. Over the course of several games, crews will rise and fall, each moving through their own stories thanks to an intricate Campaign system. On the tabletop, players control a unique group of miniatures, representing a core Faction from the Fallout universe, and bring them to battle the crews of other players in a fast-paced, dice-hurling, action-packed skirmish wargame—where every action can have long-lasting consequences.

Each player takes control of one of six Great Houses of Westeros, then sets out on an epic campaign of combat and politics to secure total dominance. This board game includes clear, detailed rules to guide you through setup and gameplay. Play begins when each person receives an army of footmen, knights, siege engines and ship units as well as a set of order tokens and other necessary components.

In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective. In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time. Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points. From the Manufacturer The Dawn of Mankind. Our ancestors were hard workers, resting only very little. Luckily for us, their ingenuity allowed them to make their work easier, day after day. In Stone Age, players are sent back to that arduous period of history. With tools, quite archaic at first, you will be able to collect wood, stone and gold. These resources will allow you to attain higher levels of knowledge and build sturdier roofs over your head. Though luck plays an im­portant part in the game, only those who master their fate will be able to grasp victory. Finally, one mustn't forget to feed their tribe as that would represent a major setback for them. Relive history.

A dazzling progression - A game of Little Factory starts with a few coins, which players can exchange for their first resources. These are arranged in 3 levels, more and more complex to obtain. The goal is to progress as quickly as possible through the resources of different levels in order to be able to build buildings, which will make your job easier, in addition to earning you valuable victory points. The first player to reach 10 points immediately wins the game. Players increase their assets by processing resources into other resources, such as turning wood into wood or charcoal, or turning charcoal and flour into bread. If you increase your assets, you can build a building and use that building to acquire resources and victory points more quickly. The more buildings players construct, the more actions that become available on future turns. On a turn, players take one of two actions: Production: Choose a resource card or building card in the production action area, and gain the item shown on it; or, Trade: Discard resource cards from your hand to acquire resource or building cards of the same value or less from the available cards. In addition, players can use the effects of each building they own once per turn (including on the turn during which they were acquired). An example of a building effect is: exchanging a thread card in hand for cloth available in the play area. Chain together cards, buildings, and actions to create more victory points. The player who collects 10+ victory points first wins! Mechanics and theme in total adequacy - With a mechanic in total synergy with its theme, Little Factory allows you to understand the game of engine-building in a particularly intuitive way, and to engage in fierce competition.

Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): 1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network. 3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5) Loan - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action: 6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.) The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham. New ""Sell"" system Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also ""grease the wheels of industry"" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. Birmingham features three all-new industry types: Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. Brass: Birmingham is a finely brewed sequel to one of history's most industrial economic games. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. Many of the tried and true strategies of the original are no longer as powerful as they once were, and other interesting new strategies are waiting for you to discover.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714P9qEhfRL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

Carefully use the town’s retainers to complete the Shogun’s tasks and win favour. The most prosperous Daimyo will be granted the title to the town. Micro Dojo is a 20 min tactical euro game for two players, intended to fit comfortably in a pocket or purse. In Micro Dojo, players take control of the Ninja, Samurai, Sumo and Geisha meeples to generate resources, develop the town, and score points by achieving the Shogun’s tasks. Each turn players move one of the four meeples to an adjacent space and take the action there - either gathering resources, taking a building, or activating a scoring objective. The catch? You can't move the last meeple either you or your opponent moved. The games end when the last objective is triggered, or a player reaches 7 points. Movement is tight, requiring you to second guess your opponents plan. Timing is crucial, triggering objective scoring only when it benefits you. Like a sparring match, every move should be chosen with precision and efficiency, or your opponent will strike.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qSBHOHkbL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, bestest castle ever — subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle they're building while also selling their services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players. The Master Builder will then pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid the Master Builder for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entrance ways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most accommodating to the King's demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613iV3jf0nL._AC_SL1280_.jpg

, Seth Godin taught readers how to make remarkable products and spread powerful ideas. But this book is different. It's about you - your choices, your future, and your potential to make a huge difference in whatever field you choose. There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now there's a third team, the linchpins. These people invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos. They figure out what to do when there's no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art. Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organizations. Like the small piece of hardware that keeps a wheel from falling off its axle, they may not be famous but they're indispensable. And in today's world, they get the best jobs and the most freedom. Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn't reach? Even once? Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the resistance that holds people back. Linchpin will show you how to join the likes of... *Keith Johnson, who scours flea markets across the country to fill Anthropologie stores with unique pieces. *Marissa Mayer, who keeps Google focused on the things that really matter. *Jason Zimdars, a graphic designer who got his dream job at 37signals without a résumé. *David, who works at Dean and Deluca coffeeshop in New York. He sees every customer interaction as a chance to give a gift and is cherished in return. As Godin writes, ""Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. It's time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you, your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious.

Dogbert shows that this could have devastating results: Employees begin to expect fair treatment and compensation, productive workers show results (making the managers look bad by comparison) and the department's future budget allotment could be decreased because it spends only what it needs.

She has earned growing fame in recent years with her vital new approach to effective management, Radical Candor

Hi I'm Dan
I created the Adventure Trek board game.
I have always been passionate about all types of adventure and board games so one day I wanted to combine the two passions and create my own adventure race board game.
It started in 2008,  I came up with some prototypes but got stuck on the playability of the game....so the project got pushed to the side.
Here are some pictures of my original vision of Adventure Trek back in 2008-2009 timeframe.

As many companies are . . . it all started out of my garage in 1992. My wife and I didn’t find a suitable multi-use table for our two children, 2 and 4 years of age. So the wife says, “why don’t you make us a table, honey?” I did. As per my wife’s instructions, I increased its size to fit the Lego/Duplo base plates (LEGO Compatible, not made by LEGOs). Then, holes around the border of the table were added to accommodate Brio-Mec, a fun construction toy at the time. Bingo, the Nilo table was born. Shortly after its arrival, our friends started flocking over to our house to see this “table” in action. They couldn’t believe it. . . our kids and theirs were playing quietly around this multi-functional table. They watched as the children played in total peace and how our house stayed in order.

Hi I'm Dan
I created the Adventure Trek board game.
I have always been passionate about all types of adventure and board games so one day I wanted to combine the two passions and create my own adventure race board game.
It started in 2008,  I came up with some prototypes but got stuck on the playability of the game....so the project got pushed to the side.
Here are some pictures of my original vision of Adventure Trek back in 2008-2009 timeframe.
Fast-forward to 2023 when one day the playability and rules came to me. (literally out of nowhere...)
I immediately got to work and created what you see today - Adventure Trek!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ITtuqPGWL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

As many companies are . . . it all started out of my garage in 1992. My wife and I didn’t find a suitable multi-use table for our two children, 2 and 4 years of age. So the wife says, “why don’t you make us a table, honey?” I did. As per my wife’s instructions, I increased its size to fit the Lego/Duplo base plates (LEGO Compatible, not made by LEGOs). Then, holes around the border of the table were added to accommodate Brio-Mec, a fun construction toy at the time. Bingo, the Nilo table was born. Shortly after its arrival, our friends started flocking over to our house to see this “table” in action.

In fact, it is fairly common among Deep Space Miners (5th class), and some say that it is almost unavoidable. And, well, it is. Especially since the crystals that you seek happen to be inside giant space beasts. To mine them, you need to, well, be eaten. But, no reason to panic. We are here to help you deal with the physical and mental challenges of being eaten. This handy simulation/survival guide is standard issue for all recruits and will eventually lead to a productive, if not potentially brief, career in space mining. Should you achieve your objective and mine enough crystals to meet your quota, it is then cost-effective for the company to activate your jet pack and extricate you from the proverbial belly of the beast. While the beast’s immune response was not enough to prevent its demise, its contribution to human progress and corporate profitability are most definitely appreciated. In the eventuality that the bacteria present in the beast overwhelm you and you are digested, do not worry. Your non-organic parts will ultimately provide much utility to future space miners. In fact, you may encounter some such pieces of equipment in your expedition, remains of attempts by evidently less-than-qualified recruits. Finally, it could transpire that you do not collect the necessary crystals by the time you reach the end of the beast's digestive tract. In this case, the so-called ""ending #2"", you will then exit the beast from the other end than the one you entered. Alive, and yet forever changed. In this case, and after a thorough decontamination and quarantine period, we will have to evaluate your performance versus that of the beast’s efforts to consume you.

This new look at the hobby searches for the historical origins of role-playing games deep in the imaginative worlds of Western culture. It looks at the earliest fantasy stories from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, at the fans--both readers and writers--who wanted to bring them to life, at the Midwestern landscape and the middle-class households that were the hobby's birthplace, and at the struggle to find meaning and identity amidst cultural conflicts that drove many people into these communities of play. This book also addresses race, religion, gender, fandom, and the place these games have within American capitalism. All the paths of this journey are connected by the very quality that has made fantasy role-playing so powerful: it binds the limitless imagination into a ""strict"" framework of rules. Far from being an accidental offshoot of marginalized fan communities, role-playing games' ability to hold contradictions in dynamic, creative tension made them a necessary and central product of the twentieth century.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HHVdozSyL._SL1500_.jpg

The promised land is represented by Gaia, which is home to the magnificent human civilization of Atlantis. But beware, other Houses (factions) of your civilization also have the same goal and only one will be able to dominate Gaia! Each player represents a different House whose rulers are viewed by terrestrial population as gods. Players build bases, recruit troops, embody gods, explore the territory, develop their own technology, sign trade contracts, defeat local dominions and other players’ armies, trying to conquer Atlantis, which owns huge treasures. Different actions will provide a certain number of immediate Victory Points. Moreover, random setup goals will provide you with sizable Victory Point rewards at the end of the game, based on specific conditions. In the end, the player with the most VPs will be the winner. In addition to having a strong dose of controllability (the luck factor is minimal), the game features an innovative starred action-selection-system that confronts players with interesting choices: players can reincarnate their gods by performing their actions in a precise sequence, on pre-established paths of their starred player board, or they can give up some deities, jumping freely from one action to another of their board, to choose the best actions on each turn. a 4x eurogame by Simone Luciani and Danilo Sabia.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61A1TEwNL7S._AC_SL1500_.jpg

Players can gather loot, battle both undead and human foes, maintain settlements, and even care for pets, all in an effort to survive and preserve their sanity. The world is a place of nightmarish violence and grim realities, and you will need all the help you can get.
Journey is an easy-to-pick-up, adaptable, story-driven experience with a streamlined combat system supported by unique loot cards. Focus on the events in the story and the choices made by the players, rather than being bogged down by complicated rulebooks. The Apocalypse is at your fingertips…

Why do fiction authors outline the rules of a game that the audience will never play? Combining perspectives from philosophy, literary theory and game studies, this book provides the first in-depth investigation into the significance of fictional games within fictional worlds. Drawing from contemporary cinema and literature, from The Hunger Games to the science fiction of Iain M. Banks, Stefano Gualeni and Riccardo Fassone introduce five key functions that different types of imaginary games have in worldbuilding. First, fictional games can emphasize the dominant values and ideologies of the fictional society they belong to. Second, some imaginary games function in fictional worlds as critical, utopian tools, inspiring shifts in the thinking and political orientation of the fictional characters. Third, a few fictional games are conducive to the transcendence of a particular form of being, such as the overcoming of human corporeality. Fourth, imaginary games within works of fiction can deceptively blur the boundaries between the contingency of play and the irrevocable seriousness of “real life”, either camouflaging life as a game or disguising a game as something with more permanent consequences. And fifth, they can function as meta-reflexive tools, suggesting critical and/or satirical perspectives on how actual games are designed, played, sold, manipulated, experienced, understood and utilized as part of our culture. With illustrations in every chapter bringing the imaginary games to life, Gualeni and Fassone creatively inspire us to consider fictional games anew: not as moments of playful reprieve in a storyline, but as significant and multi-layered expressive devices.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Odqd8W7wL._SL1024_.jpg

What is Blitz Theory? Blitz Theory is a groundbreaking new approach to chess openings based on a massive statistical analysis of online blitz games. The database includes over 20 million games played on Lichess with an average rating of approximately 2500 (top 0.1% of blitz players). To generate the 40 variations that comprise the repertoire, we crowdsourced the moves most frequently chosen by top players. We then conducted formal statistical tests in each and every position -- based on real game outcomes -- to determine whether an alternative move is an improvement over the main line.
The book is accessible to chess players of all skill levels. To play through the moves, simply turn the page to update the chess board diagram. Variations are ordered based on opponent move frequency, so the variations you learn first are the ones you're most likely to encounter. For those wanting to go deeper, we include a dynamic data visualization that updates with new information as the variation unfolds. We additionally provide ranked lists of the most extreme statistical findings, including:
- The top 30 repertoire improvements;
- The top 30 suboptimal opponent moves; and
- The top 30 opponent improvements.
The Blitz Theory algorithm is completely automated. It takes a chess position and outputs a repertoire. Visit www.blitztheory.com to check out other repertoires and sign up for our monthly newsletter.

Gordon Calleja examines key aspects of board game experience—the nature of play, attention, rules, sociality, imagination, narrative, materiality, and immersion—to offer a theory of board game experience and a model for understanding game involvement that is relevant to the analysis, criticism, and design of board games. Drawing on interviews with 32 leading board game designers and critics, Calleja—himself a board game designer—provides the set of conceptual tools that board game design has thus far lacked. After considering different conceptions of play, Calleja discusses the nature and role of attention and goes on to outline the key forms of involvement that make up the board game playing experience. In subsequent chapters, Calleja explores each of these forms of involvement, considering both the experience itself and the design considerations that bring it into being. Calleja brings this analysis together in a chapter that maps how these forms of involvement come together in the moment of gameplay, and how their combination shapes the flow of player affect. By tracing the processes by which players experience these moments of rule-mediated, imagination-fueled sociality, Calleja helps us understand the richness of the gameplay experience packed into the humble board game box.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TMa4yOXBL._SL1500_.jpg

Board games harness the creation of entirely new worlds. From the medieval warlord to the modern urban planner, players are permitted to inhabit a staggering variety of roles and are prompted to incorporate preexisting notions of placemaking into their decisions. To what extent do board games represent the social context of their production? How might they reinforce or subvert normative ideas of community and fulfillment? In Playing Place
,
Chad Randl and D. Medina Lasansky have curated a collection of thirty-seven fascinating essays, supplemented by a rich trove of photo illustrations, that unpack these questions with breadth and care.
Although board games are often recreational objects, their mythologies and infrastructure do not exist in a vacuum—rather, they echo and reproduce prevalent cultural landscapes. This thesis forms the throughline of pieces reflecting on subjects as diverse as the rigidly gendered fantasies of classic mass-market games; the imperial convictions embedded in games that position player-protagonists as conquerors establishing dominion over their “discoveries”; and even the uncanny prescience of games that have players responding to a global pandemic. Representing a thrilling convergence of historiography, architectural history, and media studies scholarship, Playing Place suggests not only that tabletop games should be taken seriously but also that the medium itself is uniquely capable of facilitating our critical consideration of structures that are often taken for granted.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Indw5IeWL._SL1500_.jpg

Lone Sherman puts you in charge of a single Sherman Tank and its crew somewhere in France in World War II, and tasks you with navigating your Sherman through varied and challenging Missions. Whilst this game is not a ‘narrative driven’ game as such, with a little imagination it will provide memorable stories. The Missions allow the Player to invent any kind of back-story they like in order to enhance the feel of the game. Some events are randomly generated, but the Player always has at least some degree of control over the level of risk they wish to take and how vulnerable they leave their Tank to these Events.
The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. Each of the 11 Missions can be played in around an hour, although sometimes a Mission will last a much shorter time if your Tank is destroyed! Each Mission provides plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and the many Events and decisions in the game.
This book is a solitaire hex and counter style wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or ‘AI’). You will need to bring at least 5, but preferably 7, standard six-sided dice. Full colour 'Mission Maps' are included.

Battles of Medieval Britain covers battles fought between the year 937 and 1403. By modern standards, the forces on each side were small in size, but battles were fierce and bloody and were no place for the faint-hearted. In many cases the exact details of the battle have never been fully established, including what weapons were used, the scale of the armies on each side, and even exactly where the battles took place. The battles in this book are only meant to be loose representations of the actual battles they depict, and in some cases deliberate changes or additions have been made to add to the play experience. But they will provide some idea of what happened at each Battle, and allow the Player to try to reproduce, or recreate, history.
In the game, the Player will be commanding various units, often representing many hundreds of men each, seeking to achieve various Objectives. Key battles from different years are included, although all fall into what is generally referred to as the medieval period. The Player will control various different armies and units depending on the battle.
The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. It also does not pretend to be entirely realistic, and many concepts have been simplified for gameplay purposes – it is not a simulation. Each Battle can be played in around 20 to 30 minutes, and each one should provide plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and composition and location of reinforcements.
This book is a solitaire wargame. You play the game, and the book will provide the “enemy”. You will need at least 4, but preferably 6, standard six-sided dice.

In the game, the Player will be commanding various units, often representing many hundreds or thousands of men each, seeking to achieve a wide variety of Objectives. Key battles from the years 1808 to 1811 are included.
The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. It also does not pretend to be entirely realistic, and many concepts have been simplified or abstracted for gameplay purposes. Each of the 20 Battle scenarios can be played in around 30 to 50 minutes, and each should provide plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and depending on how the Battle plays out.
Full colour Rules, Battle Maps and Counter Sheet are included.

. Command an American B-17 Flying Fortress bomber during the 1942-44 bombing campaigns of World War II.
Your B-17 missions will take you to various locations in Europe during the war, from the skies of France to the heart of Germany. Your plane and crew will face bad weather, chance circumstances, Axis air defenses, and fighter planes determined to stop your bombing missions. The Axis forces are an autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) BOT player. The goal is to earn victory points from successful bombing runs and downed enemy fighters, all while keeping your crew safe.
The Axis forces have stacked the deck against you. Still, success and survival can be achieved with careful planning, good flying, and keeping the target in sight. Good luck!
To play the B-17 Solitaire Bookgame, you will need to provide a pen and at least one six sided die, we recommend two. Each set of Map and Plane pages have 3 different missions, with 30 unique missions in total. There are two chances to play each mission, in Book 1 and Book 2 which provides a total of 60 missions. A dice rolling smart phone application can be used in place of the dice.
A quick example of the exciting gameplay:
Mission 1: Rail Yards at Rouen, France
Your first bombing mission in Europe should be an easy milk run. Let’s show them what we got.
Starting in the south of England with a clear weather report, you take off and rendezvous with your squadron. Moving south, you are in the lead formation. You tick off squares on the map, noting your remaining fuel each turn. As you enter enemy air space in turn 2, you encounter fighter resistance. Rolling one die, you roll a 4, easily avoiding any fighter engagement.
As you continue to fly, they come at you again. Rolling a 2 brings the fighters to your doorstep. As you roll again, a 5, Fighters High. The top turret springs into action. Shells rain down into the cockpit as you roll for your gunner action. Another 5. Engine 3, just outside your co-pilot’s window, starts to spew oil, and then the top gunner screams out, “I’m Hit!”
Next, moving further south, noting your fuel consumption again, flak appears on the horizon. When flak is encountered, you roll a 2! Heavy flak begins to burst all around you. You roll a die again to see where it hits and get a 6. Both engines 1 and 2 are aflame, and one damage is marked on each engine.
As the flak subsides, the infamous German Luftwaffe Messerschmitt 109s are spotted. “Fighters incoming,” your top gunner yells across the radio. Rolling a die, you roll a 2... they have found your fort. Rolling again to plot their direction, you get a 4. “Fighters, 9 o’clock!” your waist gunner calls as he squeezes off a few fiery bursts from his 50-caliber machine gun.
Rolling a die again, it’s a 1! A stream of smoke and fire fills the sky as the 109 is no more. There is no time to celebrate, though; you still need to make it across the coast and into France to give one of Hitler’s railyards its final stop.
Turning east into the next square, both flak and fighters are avoided by rolling a 5 and 6. With your eyes locked on the target, you advance into the next square. As you fly into the target square, flak fills the sky. Rolling a 2, the flak jars your plane and with a damage roll of 3, the rudder is hit. Fighters appear, but with a roll of 6, they miss you.
As you prepare your bombing run, you plan to come in at a low altitude. Passing the controls to the Bombardier, he carefully lines up the target in the bombsight and waits for the perfect shot.” Bombs away,” he shouts as he turns off the auto-pilot, and you take back the controls. Rolling a 5, modified to a 4 for the low altitude, gains you a hit and scores you 4 VP. He did great.

,
or run the guns of Vicksburg!
The clash of the ironclad gunships CSS Virginia and USS Monitor at the Battle of Hampton Roads on March 9, 1862 heralded a new age of naval warfare. The steam-powered engines introduced earlier in the century had already revolutionized the mobility of nineteenth-century ships, freeing vessels of their reliance on the caprice of winds, or the dictates of river flows. The innovations begun by the industrial revolution yielded powerful new warships, armed with strong new guns, and plated with thick armor. A new ironclad navy threatened to revolutionize the practice of naval warfare, rendering the old wooden fleet obsolete.
This solitaire game explores the use of ironclads during the American Civil War through a series of scripted scenarios that teach the system gradually. Scenarios take 15 to 30 minutes to play. Each consists of a historical introduction, a playsheet (left), and a mapsheet (right). All you need is a pencil, a few six-sided dice, and some generic game tokens.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61u9bNqax7L._SL1293_.jpg

Hill of Doves is a solitaire boardgame in which the player controls An Imperial British Army at war with a programmed non-player Transvaal Republican Army in 1881. The British army’s aim is to win the war by controlling the area known as Laing’s Nek which lies on the border between Natal and the Transvaal. The British army has up to twelve weeks to achieve this, failing which, the Boers will win the war. Hill of Doves is played at a strategic, operational and tactical level simultaneously. There are three phases to the game which are detailed on the Sequence of Play Cards. The Operational Phase is the heart of the game and represents a seven-day cycle, with a Strategic Phase being referred to at the end of each Operational Phase to resolve situations occurring during the week just passed and a Tactical Phase representing a variable number of hours being referred to each time the British carry out an assault. Hill of Doves is played using a programmed system whereby the player follows the instructions on the Sequence of Play cards aided by the step marker and the Set-up Card. If any battles are to be fought the player will be referred to the Tactical Deck or the Ambush Deck to resolve the battle and then the player will be prompted to return to the Operational Deck to continue the war. Hill of Doves is played on three boards simultaneously. These are the Strategic Board, Operational Board and Tactical Board. Game information is recorded on these boards and British strategic, operational and tactical columns are maneuvered on the maps located on these boards. Once the rules have been mastered, Hill of Doves can be played solely by referring to the Sequence of Play Cards mentioned above and a game can be concluded in a single evening.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VybJN7TiL._SL1294_.jpg

Many of these troops formed into small groups, organised by officers and NCOs and fought behind enemy lines for up to five days. Although mainly fighting for their own lives, these groups also helped to clear significant parts of the more organised German resistance. The Fields of Normandy XL requires you to control small groups of soldiers to clear the areas presented of that German resistance.
This game is accessible, fairly quick playing, highly replayable and fun, whilst maintaining the need for tactical thinking and decision making.
If you have played The Fields of Normandy 2
, then you will already be familiar with many of the rules for The Fields of Normandy XL
. However, there are some material differences to look out for:
Maps consist of almost twice as many hexes – 48 hexes compared to 28.
There are now 15 potential enemy positions for each mission compared to 12 and these are, to some extent, positioned randomly each time rather than being fixed.
Missions run to a maximum of 14 turns compared to 10.
Maps include a new Terrain feature – Walls (instead of fences, which had no gameplay effect). Walls do have gameplay effects.
Your US force now includes two new Units – a Lieutenant Unit and a Sniper Unit which both have their own Order charts.
The Lieutenant now calls in Artillery strikes and therefore US Rifle Squads no longer do.
US Rifle Squads can now clear Mines (or more thematically perhaps, establish a clear route through them).
There is now a stacking limit of three US Units per hex.
A German Tiger (tank) might appear!
German Snipers are now a separate unit and operate independently to Rifle Squads.
German Artillery usually has more than one possible location hex per map.
In the game, you will be controlling small groups of soldiers consisting of three Rifle Squads, a Machine Gun Team, a Bazooka Team, a Mortar Team, a Sniper Team and a Lieutenant, moving them around the hex maps and undertaking other orders to achieve the objective.

Fully half of the Allied casualties suffered on the five invasion beaches were incurred on ‘Bloody Omaha’. At noon, General Omar Bradley was contemplating abandoning Omaha and re-directing follow-on forces to Utah beach.

Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord). The campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle. To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent. Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics: No dice are used Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle. Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn. Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events. Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pacjjPPWL._AC_SL1000_.jpg

Based on the popular Quartermaster General system, this card-driven wargame reflects the military, economic, and political intrigue of the time. In Quartermaster General: 1914, each power has its own unique deck of cards, with its own strengths and strategies, providing strong replayability as you try your hand at playing the different powers. Each card has two different uses: one when played, and another when prepared. On their turn, players can both play and prepare a card. They can also spend cards to draft more troops or use cards to subject their opponents to attrition. Each Power’s deck represents the resources of that player: “digging” too quickly through the deck in the early game might result in unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds. This is worth it if a player can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915 - but if the gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead. The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding enough lead. Quartermaster General: 1914 is a must-have for all fans of the Quartermaster General series, and for anybody looking for an accessible grand-strategy game on the “Great War.”",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818PJTxsbtL._SL1500_.jpg

ONUS! Traianus features 8 ancient armies: Roman Empire, Roman Auxiliaries, Dacian kingdom, Parthian Empire, Sarmatians, Mercenaries, Celts and Germanic peoples. Each army has its strengths and weaknesses, and you have an option to gather whatever units you see fit, based on a point cost system.
The game provides an immense pool of strategies, inspired by real battles: units can change their formation, envelop enemies or approach them from flanks or from the rear to gain advantage - and sometimes to win it's enough not to destroy a unit, but to break their morale to cause it to flee!

Aces of Valor is a solitaire game where you command a fighter squadron on the Western Front during World War I through a campaign of multiple missions to score as many victory points as possible to assist the war effort. You can play as the Germans, or one the Entente powers (British, French, or Americans). Each aircraft counter represents the pilot and the aircraft combined, and your squadron will have up to eight at any given time. The player chooses the campaign’s duration (8, 12 or 16 missions), and draws a card to determine the objective of each mission, which includes patrols, trench strafing, photo recon, artillery spotting, balloon busting, and bomber escort. The player’s flight moves across a gridded map that is a semi-historical representation of the Western front. Anti-aircraft fire is heaviest near the trenches but can happen anywhere over enemy territory. When combat occurs, aircraft are moved to an “Initiative Track” for up to three rounds of combat, where pilot skill, aircraft performance, and luck all come into play to determine the outcome. The player earns mission points by destroying enemy aircraft and ground targets, and also by escorting bomber and 2-seater aircraft on successful bombing, photo reconnaissance and artillery support missions. When the flight lands, mission points are converted to victory points or used to repair and replace aircraft as well as upgrade aircraft to newer, better models. The goal is to earn enough victory points to achieve a minor, major or strategic victory.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bhxQIW1rL._SL1500_.jpg

Written as a textbook, Designing Wargames should appeal to board and computer game designers, board game players, and designers of serious war games for historical and military study. Phillies opens with a discussion of the basic elements combined to create strategic games, including representation, theme, style, mechanisms, voice, shape, and content. To introduce non-players to board wargames, he describes in detail the play of four classic board wargames, namely Stalingrad, 1914, Panzerblitz, and Fall of Manjukuo. A path to designing a game, stressing the central importance of iterative development and playtesting, is advanced. Several fundamental mechanisms and their variations, including the zone of control and command and control rules, are examined in detail. A case study contrasts a half-dozen games on a single historic campaign, comparing how different designers have created radically different games that represent the same historic outcomes. A paragraph by paragraph analysis of the written rules of one game is given. Issues related to luck and technology are examined. An extensive set of homework problems, many in the form of development projects, support the material in the text.

B0CK3TDWGV,"The Hunt , Two Player Only Strategy Board Game , Historic WWII Themed Naval Battle - 25th Century Games",0,0,0,0,"Tally-Ho! is an air war game book that puts you into the role of a Sector Controller during the Battle of Britain in the Summer of 1940. You direct Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter squadrons as you struggle to protect England from attack by incoming Luftwaffe raids. There are too many raiders and too few RAF aircraft, yet you have one major advantage – England’s “Chain Home” radar network.
Fifteen individual missions are included in this book-based game. Each mission relates to one of the key aerial engagements of the Battle of Britain. Most missions can be completed in less than thirty minutes. This is not a simulation of air-to-air combat between individual fighter planes, nor is it intended to be a realistic depiction of the air war. Rather, it is an entertaining educational tool that allows you to experience the story of the conflict through strategic decision-making set against a backdrop of the real history of the Battle of Britain – as if you were there.
Tally-Ho! is designed for experienced and novice war gamers alike. It is quick and easy to play yet deeply challenging. Though dice play a role, the outcome of each mission rests on your shoulders. Where you deploy your fighters, what orders you give, and what tactics you employ are the critical factors that determine the outcome of each mission. You decide which enemy aerial formations to engage and how to prioritize the Luftwaffe raids as you struggle with radio communications and the fog of war
.
Most of the time, you cannot stop the Luftwaffe. Bombs will fall. Airfields will be strafed. Convoys at sea will suffer. London will undergo the ""Blitz"". Your performance in each mission will affect the setup of subsequent missions by reducing or increasing the number of aircraft on each side. If you direct your squadrons skillfully, you might prevail and save England.
When you have completed all fifteen missions, the results are tallied to create a formal Fighter Command War Report, which you can read yourself. Based on your results, the War Cabinet and Parliament vote to fight on or surrender
.
If you failed in your mission to protect England from Luftwaffe attacks, what choice would the Parliament have but to negotiate terms with Berlin to spare the nation from invasion?
Meanwhile, in the coastal ports of France, the German Wehrmacht is preparing for Operation Seelöwe – the invasion of England. Intelligence reports indicate that Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess may be planning a personal flight in a Messerschmitt Bf 110 on a “journey of peace” to meet with the Duke of Hamilton at his home of Dungavel House, in Glasgow, Scotland. Will his flight be to accept England’s surrender or will it go down in history as the folly of a madman?

This excellent handbook by R. C. Bell is a basic reference to board and table games from around the world, and one of the two or three finest books ever written on the subject. Originally published in two volumes in the 1960's, it is now available for the first time in a corrected, one-volume edition.
Mr. Bell's encyclopedic work provides the rules and methods of play for 182 different games: Ma-jong, Hazard, Wei-ch'I (Go), backgammon, Wari, Continental draughts, Pachisi, Japanese chess, Bidou, Domino Loo, Cribbage, and many others. Volume one is divided into chapters devoted to race games, war games, games of position, Mancala games, dice games, and domino games; volume two follows the same arrangement and then proceeds to games with numbers, card games requiring boards, and games requiring manual dexterity. Additional information is furnished on making boards and pieces, and on gaming-counters.
Game players, toymakers, and historians of culture will welcome this guided tour of games from Egypt, Meso-America, the Orient, India, Persia, Rome, Africa, Victorian England, and many other societies.

Ghosts of Saltmarsh: A D&D Adventure System Cooperative Game is an expansion to any of the previous Adventure System games! It features new adventures, map tiles, monsters, traps and spells. Just select your favorite heroes, and get ready for an all-new campaign! The King of Keoland, after unsuccessful expansion to the north, has turned his eyes southward, to Saltmarsh, with the intention of turning this village into an important port to increase the stature of his kingdom. But not everyone in the village is happy about the new developments, and old enemies fight for control, unaware of a new enemy about to rear its ugly head. You come through the town gates and cross Sharkfin Bridge…to the screams of townsfolk and the unmistakable sounds of fighting. You do not know the situation but you are sure you are needed. Return to the classic gameplay of the D&D Adventure System, with some exciting new changes! You’ll still take on the role of a D&D hero, with thematic skills and abilities, and either on your own, or as a group of up to 5 adventurers. You’ll face multiple scenarios in an overarching campaign, evolving and leveling up your character on the way. You’ll explore treacherous dungeons, avoid deadly traps, and defeat terrifying monsters. You can also play your favorite scenarios on their own as a stand-alone experience!

You’ll add these to the miniatures from your Adventure System Games to populate the board, using included tokens to represent any monsters you may not already have.

It’s an exciting and different game mode, where without exploration, the new Adventure deck provides the challenges and surprises that stand between the Heroes and success. This Premium edition includes 8 pre-painted, highly-detailed miniatures in place of the unpainted miniatures of the standard edition. FAQ: What pieces do I need from a full Adventure System Game? The hero characters, including their minis, tiles, and cards. Healing surges, HP tokens, Wound tokens, a treasure deck, and some other basic tokens. Does it matter which adventure system game I use? No, but there may be some slight differences. You’ll use the rules from your adventure system game of choice where not covered by the Ghosts of Saltmarsh rulebook. If your game did not include GP tokens, you will need to track gold some other way. Otherwise, necessary components that do not appear in all games have the tokens and rules included. Can I use my monster minis? Yes! In the Ghosts of Saltmarsh campaign, you’ll encounter select monsters from all other Adventure System Games! It includes 8 new monsters miniatures, and tokens to represent monsters from earlier games, any of which can be swapped out for a miniature from your collection!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a5InhO7fL._AC_SL1500_.jpg
